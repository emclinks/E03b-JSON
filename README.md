# E03b-JSON

This is an exercise edit of the JSON from the text-adventure game ZORK, made for the class MSCH-G220 Game Technology. This should hopefully patch some odds and ends wholes created in the code to aid to teach students in the class about how to edit JSONs and how they approximately work.

Have fun! - Emily Clinkscales
